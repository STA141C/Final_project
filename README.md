# STA141C Final Project

## Data engineering: create a R package called BLRF

## Introduction to BLRF
This library combines bag of Little Bootstraps, also known as BLB, to replace the process of ordinary bootstrapping in the standard Random Forest algorithm in order to gain more robustness in prediction for random forest classification as well as regression.

## Examples shown how to use this package
